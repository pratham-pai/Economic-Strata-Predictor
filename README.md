Economic Strata Prediction System Documentation
Introduction
The Economic Strata Prediction System is a machine learning initiative aimed at predicting whether an individual earns over a specific threshold annually based on demographic attributes. It leverages census data to compile comprehensive insights into housing conditions, demographics, social dynamics, and economic attributes. The system's primary objective is to facilitate enhanced service planning, quality of life improvements, and resolution of prevailing issues.

Data Fetching
The project fetches data from the adult dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It provides a comprehensive overview of demographic attributes, including age, education, marital status, occupation, race, gender, and native country.

Data Cleaning
Missing values in the dataset are addressed, ensuring data integrity for subsequent analysis. Categorical attributes are encoded for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering
The project employs feature engineering techniques to transform and enrich the dataset. This involves categorizing education levels, marital status, occupation, and other attributes for deeper analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA techniques such as pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and bivariate analysis are employed to gain insights into the relationships between different attributes and income levels.

Building Machine Learning Models
Various classification models, including Perceptron, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine, Radical Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, are explored and evaluated for their predictive performance.

Takeaways
The documentation concludes with key insights drawn from the analysis and modeling process, highlighting the most effective predictors and potential areas for further investigation
